                <h4>College:</h4>
                <p>I'm currently attending <strong>Cornell University</strong> in <strong class="pink-emphasis">Ithaca,
                        NY</strong> as a freshman planning on studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> in the College
                    of Engineering with minors in Business and (potentially) Information Science.<br/> <br/>I'm hoping to explore
                    different niches of computer science, including computer vision and machine learning, in my future
                    classes. I want to learn as much as possible here in college to prepare myself for a potential
                    future in the tech industry.</p>

        <h4>High School:</h4>
        <p>For high school, I attended Cherry Creek High School. There I participated in clubs such as the National
            Honor Society, Future Business Leaders of America, and more (you can find more details <a
                href="experience.html">here</a>).<br/><br/>During my time there, I had a cumulative 4.75 weighted GPA and a 3.97
            unweighted GPA. I was also a high honor roll student, a National Merit Finalist, and a recipient of the
            Exceptional Quality in Activities award.
